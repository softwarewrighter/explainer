The Ralph Wiggum Technique: Put Claude in a While Loop

What if you could ship 6 production repos overnight for under $300? YC teams are doing it. Named after the Simpsons character who keeps trying despite setbacks, the Ralph Wiggum technique puts Claude Code in a while loop and lets it iterate autonomously.

The core idea is brilliantly simple:
while true; cat PROMPT.md | claude; done

Claude sees its previous work in files and git. Each iteration it reads what it built and improves. The loop stops when it outputs a completion promise.

In this video I show a real example: adding comprehensive tests to a Rust WebAssembly component. Zero tests to full coverage in 6 iterations with no manual intervention.

The /ralph-loop plugin is built into Claude Code. Try it on your next project.
