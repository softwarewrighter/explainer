Neural networks can feel like magic. You feed in data, adjust some weights, and somehow it learns. This platform lets you watch every step.

In this video, I walk through an interactive neural network training platform built in Rust with WebAssembly. Train networks on eight different examples, from simple logic gates (AND, OR, XOR) to real-world datasets like Iris classification.

Features shown:
- Command-line interface for quick training runs
- Browser-based Web UI with live visualization
- Real-time training progress with loss curves
- Network architecture display with neuron activations
- Truth table verification for logic gates
- Parameter tuning for convergence (learning rate, epochs, hidden layers)

The XOR and PARITY3 examples demonstrate why some problems require hidden layers and careful hyperparameter selection.

Try it yourself:
- Live Demo: https://sw-ml-study.github.io/neural-net-rs/
- Source Code: https://github.com/sw-ml-study/neural-net-rs

Built with Rust + WebAssembly. No installation required - runs entirely in your browser.
