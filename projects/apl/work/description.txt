In 1972, I wrote my first program on an IBM 2741 Selectric terminal connected to an IBM 360 mainframe. It was a horse race simulator written in APL. Fifty years later, I recreated it using GNU APL on Linux.

The code is about 40 lines, but it's not idiomatic. An experienced APL programmer could write it in far fewer.

This video explores the hardware, the code, and the magic of array programming.

Fun fact: The APL typeball had no lowercase letters. Just uppercase, numbers, and all those strange mathematical symbols.
