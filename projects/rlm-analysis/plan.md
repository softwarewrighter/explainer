# RLM Analysis Explainer Video

## Overview
Deep dive into how RLM (Recursive Language Model) works internally.

## Target Audience
Developers interested in understanding the algorithm behind RLM.

## Key Topics (TBD)
- [ ] How RLM recursively narrows search space
- [ ] Token efficiency analysis
- [ ] Comparison with RAG approaches
- [ ] Code walkthrough
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## Assets Needed
- [ ] Title image
- [ ] Architecture diagrams (SVG)
- [ ] Code demos (VHS recordings)
- [ ] Flowcharts

## Video Structure (Draft)
1. Hook - "How does RLM search 3MB documents with only 3K tokens?"
2. Problem - Context window limitations
3. Solution overview - Recursive search strategy
4. Deep dive - Algorithm walkthrough
5. Demo - Live code execution
6. Results - Token savings comparison
7. CTA - Try it yourself

## Notes
- Use VHS for code demos (proven to work with TUI recording)
- Consider split-screen: code + visualization
