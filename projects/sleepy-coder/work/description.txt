What if your AI coding assistant could actually learn from yesterday's mistakes?

Sleepy Coder is a practical demonstration of parameter-efficient continual learning for coding agents. During the day, the agent works and its failures are logged. Overnight, the model is fine-tuned on those failures using low-rank adapters in a shared subspace. Each new checkpoint wakes up a little smarter.

This video walks through the architecture, shows the agent loop in action, and demonstrates measurable improvement over multiple sleep cycles.
