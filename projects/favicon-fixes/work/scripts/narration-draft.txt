01: Here's the fave icon repository on GitHub. Let's start Claude Code and see what needs fixing.

02: Claude Code starts up and I ask it to read the to do file with all the bugs we discovered in the part one video. Link in the description.

03: The to do file shows six bugs, two feature requests, and one documentation gap. Nine items total to fix.

04: I tell Claude to start with the high severity bugs first. Named colors, transparent, and unicode code points.

05: Claude begins by reading the source files to understand the codebase structure.

06: It searches for where colors are parsed in the code. Found forty six rust files to examine.

07: After reading the code, Claude understands the issues and plans the implementation.

08: First fix, adding named color support. Maroon, aqua, silver, gold, and other common color names.

09: Next, implementing transparent as a valid color and improving the color matching logic.

10: Now the unicode code point parsing. Supporting both the U plus format and plain hex numbers.

11: Building the project with cargo to compile all the changes.

12: Testing bug six, the unicode code point. U plus two seven six four now renders as a heart. Fixed.

13: Testing bug one, named colors. Red on blue background works perfectly now.

14: Running cargo clippy to check for any code issues. All three high severity bugs are fixed.

15: Running cargo format to clean up the code style before committing.

16: Creating the git commit. Add named colors, transparent support, and plain hex code points.

17: Pushing the changes to the main branch on GitHub.

18: Moving on to bug five, the wrench symbol that was rendering as text instead of an icon.

19: Adding wrench, tool, and hammer to the symbols file so they render as icons.

20: Fixing bug three, the PNG filename issue. Now it defaults to fave icon dot png as expected.

21: All tests pass and clippy reports no errors. Time for a checkpoint.

22: Running through the demo checklist. Demos one through four all pass verification.

23: Demos five through seven also pass. All the high and medium severity bugs are fixed.

24: I point out that Claude hasn't actually shown me the visual output yet. Show me the results.

25: Claude starts creating animated GIF demos to show the fixes in action.

26: Demo six, creating animated GIFs. A spinning gear and a spinning star.

27: I ask to see the actual demo images displayed on screen.

28: Displaying the wrench demo. The wrench symbol now renders correctly as an icon.

29: This demo is broken. The red on black image has a display issue we need to investigate.

30: Displaying the heart from hex code point. Two seven six four renders as a heart emoji.

31: The animated GIF is too slow. Let's check the frame delay argument.

32: Trying a faster frame delay of ten. Still not quite right.

33: Even with frame delay one, it's still too slow. Something else is wrong.

34: The GIF isn't moving at all now. Let's check the code to see how frame delay works.

35: Found the issue. Frame delay in GIF format is measured in centiseconds, not milliseconds.

36: Fixing the frame delay with proper centisecond values. Twenty centiseconds should work.

37: Still no visible movement. Need to investigate the GIF rendering code further.

38: Opening the demo page in the browser to see all the results together.

39: The fave icon demo page shows custom colors and rotation demos all working.

40: The animated GIF section is visible. Let's see if the animations are working now.

41: I ask how it looks. Much better. The demos are displaying correctly in the browser.

42: Displaying the remaining demo items to verify everything works.

43: Checking the wrench, heart hex, and star transparent demos. All rendering correctly.

44: Updating the demo HTML to include the spinning wrench GIF animation.

45: Adding the spinning star animation to the demo page as well.

46: Refreshing the browser to see the updated animations.

47: Good. The animations are working correctly now. Spinning gear and star both animate.

48: Checking the final status table. Bug five and bug six both pass.

49: Feature one passes, feature two is partial, and the documentation is complete.

50: Eight of nine items are complete. Just need to finish updating the help text.

51: I ask why the foreground can't be transparent. That would be useful for cutout effects.

52: Claude checks the rendering code to see if transparent foreground is possible.

53: Building and testing the transparent foreground feature.

54: Displaying the result. Transparent foreground creates a nice cutout effect.

55: All nine original items are complete, plus we added a bonus feature for transparent foreground.

56: Creating the final git commit for the documentation updates.

57: Adding the fave icon to do file and pushing all changes to GitHub.

58: Done. All bugs fixed, features added, and documentation updated. Ready for the test suite.
