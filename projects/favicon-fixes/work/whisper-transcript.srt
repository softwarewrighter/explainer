1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,980
 In Part 1, Claude discovered 6 bugs, 2 missing features, and a documentation gap.

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,500
 Now watch as Claude fixes every single one of them, runs the tests, and validates the

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,080
 results.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,260
 This is Vibe Coding, Part 2.

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,480
 Here's the favicon repository on GitHub.

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,160
 Starting Claude code.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,500
 Now Claude wants to know if I trust the files in this project folder.

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,320
 Welcome back.

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,720
 Now I ask Claude to read the todo file from the Part 1 video.

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,200
 Claude asks permission to read the todo file.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,600
 Nine items total.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,040
 Claude reads through the entire list.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,800
 I tell Claude to start with the high severity bugs first.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,480
 Claude starts planning the bug fixes.

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,040
 Claude begins by reading the source files.

16
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,840
 Forty-six Rust files to explore.

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,320
 This could take a while.

18
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,660
 It's building a mental map of the codebase.

19
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,800
 Searching for where colors are parsed in the code.

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,960
 Found the color module.

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,760
 Reading through it now.

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,360
 Still analyzing the color module.

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,760
 Sorry to thaw it, I'm going to explain it.

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,320
 Now Claude understands the issues and plans the fixes.

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,280
 Adding named color lookup table.

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,320

 Updating module exports for new color types.

30
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,760
 Adding Unicode code point detection logic.

31
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,080

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,120
 Time for a coffee break.

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,280
 Tests running with CLI argument errors.

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,320

 Pushing the changes to GitHub.

61
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,120
 Git push origin main.

62
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,800
 The magic words.

63
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
 Things are live.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
 Moving on to the next book.

65
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,360
 Now testing PNG.

66
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,960
 File name output handling.

67
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:58,760
 Claude found that PNG files save as .ico instead of .png.

68
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,600
 Reading CLI argument handling code.

69
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,520
 Adding wrench to the symbols file.

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,200
 Also adding tool and hammer while we're here.

71
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,120
 Testing both file name and wrench symbol fixes.

72
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,560
 Bug 3, the PNG file name issue.

73
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,560
 Running cargo tests on the code base.

74
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,080
 Running cargo format and Clippy checks.

75
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,000
 Bug 3 fixed.

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,480
 All tests pass.

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,800
 No Clippy errors.

78
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,440
 I ask Claude to run the demo guide first.

79
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,600
 Claude is running through the demo checklist.

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,360
 Let's verify the demo's work.

81
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,680
 Running through the demo checklist.

82
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:19,360
 I notice Claude didn't display visual results.

83
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,680
 I ask to see actual display output for each demo.

84
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,240
 I ask to clean up old demo outputs first.

85
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,360
 Claude cleaning up old demo files before running again.

86
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:46,800
 Creating demo directory and running demo1 favicon.

87
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,040
 demo1 text favicon files being created and read.

88
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:59,880
 Claude generating demo2 Unicode symbol images.

89
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:06,120
 Now the demo2 symbol images are being created and verified.

90
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,080
 Claude reading demo2 image file sizes.

91
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:18,720
 demo2 verified starting demo3 coldpoint demos.

92
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:27,120
 Goom03 creating Unicode code point favicon images.

93
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,440
 Goom03 code point images created and verified.

94
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,880
 Goom04 creating custom color favicon images.

00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:47,400
 Goom06 creating animated GIF files.

96
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,480
 Goom06 creating the animated GIF.

97
00:07:53,480 --> 00:08:00,000
 Goom07 listing available symbol aliases.

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Claude showing all DOM who's passed with bug fixes verified.

99
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,080
 All bugs verified, I ask to see actual visual output.

100
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,480
 I point out Claude has not used display command yet.

101
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:27,520
 I request visual demonstration of all the demo's.

102
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:35,560
 Claude acknowledges and prepares to display image.

103
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:42,400
 Not finding image viewer and opening wrenchdom O.

104
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,760
 I clarify I want the display command specific.

105
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:55,480
 I clarify I want the image magic display command.

106
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:02,800
 I explain that display refers to the image magic display tool.

107
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,960
 Claude switching to image magic display command.

108
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,680
 Wrench image now displaying via image magic displaying.

109
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,480
 Wrench favicon displaying correctly in image magic window.

110
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,120
 Display command finished.

111
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,560
 Wrench icon shown successfully.

112
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,280
 We'll come back to this one.

113
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,920
 Laying the heart from hex code.

114
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,200
 They red on black dim all shows an empty red square.

115
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,240
 Something's wrong.

116
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,640
 Let me investigate the red on black issue.

117
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:59,680
 Claude discovers the X text is being converted to the X symbol alias.

118
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,120
 Claude reads the text resolution code to understand the bug.

119
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:13,160
 Claude identifies the bug and shows the fix for text flag handling.

120
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,920
 Building the fix, but there's a compilation error.

121
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:27,240
 After fixing, the X icon now renders correctly as liberal text.

122
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,560
 Now displaying the animated gear gif.

123
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,440
 The animation is too slow.

124
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,280
 I scout speed settings.

125
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,560
 Checking the help for frame delay options.

126
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,020
 Found it.

127
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,600
 Frame delay in milliseconds trying delay 20.

128
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,640
 Offering faster gear gif with 20 months prior.

129
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,960
 Still too slow so trying a frame delay of 10.

130
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,080
 Even delay 10 is too slow.

131
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,200
 Trying delay 1.

132
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,040
 Still too slow with delay 1.

133
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,320
 Something is wrong.

134
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,120
 Claude tries more frames with minimal delay.

135
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,520
 I suggest the argument might be named differently.

136
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:36,000
 Claude searches for how frame delay is used in the code.

137
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,240
 Searching through the code base for frame delay implementation.

138
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,720
 Found it.

139
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,760
 Jif uses send seconds, testing with delay are off.

140
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,840
 Generating CUS_JIF with 170 second delay.

141
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:01,440
 Classic units confusion happens to everyone.

142
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,880
 Claude reads the JIF runner source code.

143
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,400
 Reading more JIF related source files.

144
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,240
 Find the issue.

145
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
 Zero values.

146
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
 Default to slow.

147
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,320
 Generating proper JIF.

148
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,760
 Regenerating the JIF with correct timing.

149
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,400
 Still no visible movement in the display.

150
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,480
 Checking the JIF file properties with identity.

151
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,180
 Still no visible movement.

152
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,680
 Try different animation settings.

153
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,960
 Too fast now but discovered display doesn't show animations properly.

154
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,200
 Debugging animated GIFs.

155
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,800
 Living the dream.

156
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,400
 Maybe the browser will show it better.

157
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,880
 I ask for an HTML page to display the JIF in browser.

158
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,920
 Cloud creates the demo HTML page and opens it.

159
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:20,020
 The most displayed custom colors section looks great.

160
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,640
 Custom colors section looks great.

161
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,080
 Custom colors section looks great.

162
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:40,600
 Much easier to see everything at once.

163
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,040
 I request slowing down the animations.

164
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:52,920
 I notice the gear teeth appear motionless due to the rotation increment.

165
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,440
 I explain the gear animation has a rotation aliasing problem.

166
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,760
 I describe how only the hub moves.

167
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,960
 Not the tysmog.

168
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,080
 I finish my feedback about the rotation increment problem.

169
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,260
 Gear is spinning, star is spinning.

170
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,760
 The animations work in the browser.

171
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:33,440
 Users handle animated GIF files natively so they display correctly.

172
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,940
 I say much better after animation fixes.

173
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,740
 Much better than before.

174
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,980
 The demos are working correctly now.

175
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,440
 I give instructions about the wrench animation.

176
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,440
 Still typing my instructions.

177
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,800
 Still typing instructions.

178
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,640
 Cloud running display commands.

179
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,480
 Cloud executing display commands.

180
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:19,360
 Cloud reading documented.

181
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,080
 Showing documentation content.

182
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,720
 Showing rotation demos.

183
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,560
 Still on wrench rotation.

184
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,240
 I ask about the wrench animation.

185
