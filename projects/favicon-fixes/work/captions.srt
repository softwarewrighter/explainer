1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,920
In part one, Claude discovered six bugs,

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,360
two missing features, and a

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:18,320
documentation gap. Now, watch as Claude

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,199
fixes every single one of them, runs the

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,119
tests, and validates the results. This

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,439
is Vibe Coding part two.

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,439
Here's the fave icon repository on

8
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,439
GitHub.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,160
Starting Claude code.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,280
Now Claude wants to know if I trust the

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,280
files in this project folder.

12
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:48,280
Welcome back. Now I ask Claude to read

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,280
the to-do file from the part one video.

14
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,960
Claude asks permission to read the to-do

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,960
file.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,840
Nine items total. Claude reads through

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,840
the entire list.

18
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,680
I tell Claude to start with the high

19
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,680
severity bugs first.

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,720
Cloud starts planning the bug fixes.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,320
Cloud begins by reading the source

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,320
files.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,840
46 Rust files to explore. This could

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,080
take a while.

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,080
It's building a mental map of the

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,080
codebase.

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,400
Searching for where colors are parsed in

28
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,880
the code.

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,040
Found the color module. Reading through

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,040
it now.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,200
Still analyzing the color module. Start

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,439
a thought. I'm going to explain it.

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,640
Now Claude understands the issues and

34
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,720
plans to fix it.

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Adding name color lookup table.

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:08,080
Continuing named colors implement.

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:14,200
Adding a lookup table for named colors.

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,200
Maroon, aqua, silver, gold, and more.

39
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,480
Updating module exports for new color

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,560
types.

41
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,560
Adding Unicode code point detection

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,560
logic.

43
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,680
Adding Unicode code point validation.

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,560
Adding tests and building project asked

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,879
owner.

46
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:44,760
Building and testing the changes.

47
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,760
Running cargo tests.

48
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,640
Compilation in progress.

49
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,800
Running cargo test.

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,680
Rest compilation.

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,680
Time for a coffee break.

52
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,120
Test running with CLI argument errors.

53
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:14,200
Code debugging. CLI argument errors.

54
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,200
Multiple bug tests complete.

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:23,000
Test results showing fixes work.

56
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Running cargo clippy.

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,560

Clippy complete. Updating to-do list.

59
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,440
Test passed. I request checkpoint.

60
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,920
I request checkpoint and the medium

61
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:48,760
bugs.

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,760
Running tests. After checkpoint request,

63
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,080

70
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,079
Commit complete.

71
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:26,360
Three bugs down.

72
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,360

85
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,560
testing both file file name and wrench

86
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:19,759
symbol fixes.

87
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:24,680
Bug three, the PNG file name issue.

88
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,680
Running cargo tests on the codebase.

90
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,039
Bug three fixed.

91
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,960
All tests pass. No clippy errors.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I asked Claude to run the demo guide

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
first.

94
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,800
Claude is running through the demo

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,280
checklist.

96
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,280
Let's verify the demo O's work.

97
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,479
Running through the demo O checklist.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,199
All demo those three set in passing

99
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,199
ready for checkpoint.

100
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,440
I noticed Claude didn't display visual

101
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,440
results.

102
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,520
I asked to see actual display output for

103
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,520
each demo.

104
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,360
I asked to clean up old demo outputs.

105
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,680
First

106
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,000
plot cleaning up old demo files before

107
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,000
running again.

108
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:41,400
Creating demo o directory and running

109
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,400
demo 01 fave icon.

110
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,680
Give me a one text fave icon files being

111
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,680
created and read.

112
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,720
Claw generating BM O2 unic code symbol

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,039
images.

114
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,680
Now the DEM O2 symbol images are being

115
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,680
created and verified.

116
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,520
Clone reading demo O2 image file sizes.

117
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,360
De O2 verified.

118
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,560
Starting demo 03

119
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,800
cold point demos.

120
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,080
Doom03

121
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,080
creating unic code point fave icon

122
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,080
images.

123
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,440
Doom 03 code point images created and

124
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,479
verified.

125
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,479
Goom04 creating custom color fave icon

126
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,479
images.

127
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,080
Goom06

128
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,680
creating animated GIF files.

129
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,720
Goom06

130
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,720
creating the animated GIF.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,440
Goooom07 listing available symbol

132
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,440

133
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:02,199
Claude showing all dam who's passed with

134
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,199
bug fixes verified.

135
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,720
All bugs verified. I asked to see actual

136
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,639
visual output.

137
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,039
Thanks

138
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,840
much to hospitaling for sick scout.

139
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,080
I request visual demonstration of all

140
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,080
the demos.

141
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:29,759
Clode acknowledges and prepares to

142
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:32,560
display image Cloind at search letters.

143
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,519
Claude finding image viewer and opening

144
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,519
wrench o.

145
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,279
I clarify I want the display command

146
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,480
spec.

147
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:49,480
I clarify I want the image magic display

148
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,480
command.

149
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,880
I explain that display refers to the

150
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,200
image magic display tool.

151
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,160
Cloud switching to image magic display

152
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,320
command.

153
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,839
Wrench image now displaying via image

154
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,920
magic displaying.

155
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:15,440
Wrench fave icon displaying correctly in

156
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,320
image magic window.

157
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,640
Display command finished. Wrench icon

158
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,640
shown successfully.

159
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:30,440
We'll come back to this one.

160
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,440
Displaying the heart from hex code.

161
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,080
The red on black dim shows an empty red

162
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,279
square.

163
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,320
Something's wrong.

164
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,320
Let me investigate the red on black

165
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,320
issue.

166
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:53,160
Cloud discovers the X text is being

167
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,160
converted to the X symbol alias.

168
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,880
Cloud reads the text resolution code to

169
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,880
understand the bug.

170
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:07,040
Cloud identifies the bug and shows the

171
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,880
fix for text flag handling.

172
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,760
Building the fix, but there's a

173
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,760
compilation error.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,320
After fixing the X icon now renders

175
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,320
correctly as liberal text

176
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,040
displaying the animated gear GIF.

177
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,040
The animation is too slow.

178
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,120
Ice scout speed settings.

179
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,120
Checking the help for frame delay

180
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,120
options.

181
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,040
Found it. Frame delay in milliseconds.

182
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,839
Trying delay 20.

183
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,640
Generating faster gear drift with 20 m

184
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,160
high.

185
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,920
Still too slow. Trying frame delay can.

186
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,240
Oh, how creation would be as I like to

187
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:04,000
talk not worrying.

188
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,000
Even delay 10 is too slow. Trying delay

189
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
one.

190
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,120
Still too slow with delay one. Something

191
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,120
is wrong.

192
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,959
Cloud tries more frames with minimal

193
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,959
delay.

194
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,040
I suggest the argument might be named

195
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,040
differently.

196
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,880
Cloud searches for how frame delay is

197
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,800
used in the code.

198
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,160
Searching through the codebase for frame

199
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:42,240
delay implementation.

200
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:45,519
Found it. GIF uses 10 seconds. Testing

201
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:51,560
with delay or

202
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,560
generating test GIF with 100C delay.

203
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,959
Classic units confusion happens to

204
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,959
everyone.

205
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:07,680
Cloud reads the GIFRunner source code

206
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,680
reading more GIF related source files.

207
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:16,680
Found the issue. Zero values default to

208
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,680
slow. Generating proper GIF.

209
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,120
Regenerating the Jeff with correct

210
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,120
timing.

211
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,959
Still no visible movement in the

212
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,720
display.

213
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,720
Checking the GIF file properties with

214
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,720
ident.

215
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:39,360
Still no visible movement.

216
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:43,320
The in girl looked online way graphites

217
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,320
on art direct beam

218
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,680
too fast now but discovered display

219
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:55,519
doesn't show animations properly

220
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:59,959
debucking animated gifs living the dream

221
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,959
maybe the browser will show it better

222
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,440
I ask for an HTML page to display the

223
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,440
GIF in browser

224
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,760
Cloud creates the demo HTML page and

225
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,760
opens it.

226
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:20,200
All the demos displayed together

227
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,200
podcasts along Kobany's estatic.

228
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,920
Custom color section looks great.

229
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,920
Custom color section looks great. Custom

230
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:34,560
colors section looks great.

231
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,560
Much easier to see everything at once.

232
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,399
I request slowing down the animations.

233
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,600
I notice the gear teeth appear

234
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,600
motionless due to rotation increment.

235
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,920
I explain that gear animation has a

236
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,920
rotation aliasing problem.

237
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:10,880
I describe how only the hub moves.

238
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,399
Not the tis

239
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,680
finish my feedback about the rotation

240
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:20,600
increment problem.

241
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,600
Gear is spinning. Star is spinning.

242
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:27,199
The animations work in the browser.

243
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:32,279
Browsers handle animated GIF files

244
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,279
natively so they display correctly.

245
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,760
Demo 06 verifes.

246
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:51,079
Much better than before.

247
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,079
The demos are working correctly. Now

248
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,440
I give instructions about the wrench

249
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,440
animation.

250
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,680
Still typing my instructions.

251
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,680
Still typing instruction.

252
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,079
Cloud running display commands.

253
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,199
Cloud executing display commands.

254
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,560
Code wasn't telling you what it cost for

255
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,120
existing

256
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,120
reading documented.

257
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:30,040

258
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,040
showing rotation dems

259
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,600
still on wrench rotation.

260
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,880
I ask about the wrench animation.

261
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,880
Clode explaining static versus animated

262
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,880
images.

263
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,120
Clode explains I request a checkpoint.

264
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,040
I request a spinning wrench animation.

265
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,120
Adding the spinning wrench.

266
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,959
Making the demo o page more complete.

267
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,959
A wrench that spins. Peak fave icon

268
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,959
technology.

269
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,720
Demo page updated.

270
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,839
Star already added. I approve the

271
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,839
result.

272
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,199
Three animations now shown running

273
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,199

274
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,360
Running tests.

275
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,360
I ask about code points.

276
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,720
Get operations.

277
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,480
Get verification.

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,560
I request a demo o.

282
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,959
I ask about document.

283
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:10,199
I ask about font docs.

284
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,199
Clog checking at locks.

285
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,520

286
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,600
Get commit push.

287
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,400
I ask about completion status.

288
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:32,679
Verification against to-do list.

289
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,679
Checking the final status table.

290
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,600
Showing feature census.

291
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,120
Status table eight of nine complete.

292
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,240
My name is partial and the college.

293
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,760
I request a help text update.

294
00:17:52,799 --> 00:18:00,679
Editing help text.

295
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,679

All items complete.

299
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,480
Cloud marks to-do items as complete.

300
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:23,640
All items complete. Feature

301
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,640
2 already complete.

302
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,360
I request a docs update.

303
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,799
Documentation.

304
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,799
The developer's least favorite task.

305
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,559
Almost done.

306
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,320
I ask about transparent or foreground

307
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,320
behavior.

308
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,120
Why can't the foreground be transparent?

309
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,760
I asked how hard it would be to add

310
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,760
guiding curs

311
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,080
updating docs.

312
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,200
Claude updating readme examples.

313
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,559
Claude checks the rendering code

314
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,520
looking for where foreground color is

315
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:17,400
applied.

316
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,400
Found the rendering logic.

317
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,880
Documentation command

318
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:29,120
cloud asks permission to implement

319
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,120
building the transparent foreground

320
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,120
feature.

321
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,679
Still editing code.

322
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,679
Start with both.

323
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,440
Still editing code in text. RS

324
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,440
build running.

325
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:53,840
Then testing.

326
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,840
Asking permission to display what?

327
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,840
Displaying the transparent foreground

328
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,840
result

329
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,360
shows solid red square

330
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,760
display failed. I'll put out the issue

331
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,840
running new test looked.

332
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,360
I caused a circuit

333
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:21,200
at least as large and narrow in town.

334
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:27,600
walks my feet. It's

335
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:33,320
I love temporary fig sort of thought.

336
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,320
Still updating docs shows error message.

337
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,720
Error message shows transparent at

Still implementing.

341
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,200
Still in the middle of implementation.

342
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,159
Verifying image transparency

343
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,080

Cloud asks about including the to-do

348
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,240
file.

349
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,919
Cloud types the commit command.

350
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,000
Committing to-do file hope it will

351
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,400
create conflication with close to

352
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,799
propulities.

353
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,320
Now where we got recently

354
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:37,960
is not supposed to be a bit

355
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,960
still committing locally.

356
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,679

357
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,760
Repository updated.

358
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,880
Done. All bugs fixed. Features added.

359
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,440
I asked Claude to run tests.

360
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,159
All six bugs fixed, plus new features

361
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,760
and updated docs. Check part one in the
