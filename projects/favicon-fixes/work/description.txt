In Part 1, Claude discovered six bugs, two missing features, and a documentation gap in my favicon CLI tool. Now watch as Claude fixes every single one of them, runs the tests, and validates the results.

All issues resolved:
- Named colors (red, blue, green, and more)
- Transparent background support
- Unicode code points (U+1F600)
- Animation GIF export
- Tests passing, docs updated
