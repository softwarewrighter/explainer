Recursive Language Models: Expand the Workspace, Not the Context

This video explains Recursive Language Models (RLM) - a technique that lets AI handle massive inputs by expanding its workspace instead of cramming everything into a limited context window.

The key insight: Instead of stuffing everything into context (where it gets forgotten or garbled), RLM stores large inputs externally and gives the AI tools to deliberately access what it needs.

BENCHMARK RESULTS

Testing methodology and results from the paper:
- Benchmark Report: https://github.com/softwarewrighter/rlm-project/blob/main/rlm-orchestrator/BENCHMARK_REPORT.md
- Findings Summary: https://github.com/softwarewrighter/rlm-project/blob/main/docs/findings.md
- Benchmarks Directory: https://github.com/softwarewrighter/rlm-project/tree/main/benchmarks

Results show 87-91% accuracy across GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Mistral, and Gemini - compared to 0% with standard prompting on context-exceeding tasks.
