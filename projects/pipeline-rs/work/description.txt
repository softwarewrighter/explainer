In 1996, IBM hosted the Olympics web server. I was in charge of the S/390 mainframes running OS/390 that collected all the logs. I used TSO Pipelines for ad hoc log analysis, statistics, and forensics.

TSO Pipelines was the MVS port of CMS Pipelines from VM. It processes fixed and variable length records, classic punch card, tape, and disk formats. You chain stages together and data flows through them.

This Throwback Thursday project recreates those mainframe pipelines in Rust, with a web-based tutorial and an interactive record-at-a-time debugger.
