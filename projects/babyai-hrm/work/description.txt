What does an AI actually learn during training? Most explanations skip this part.

This video opens the black box of AI training. Watch a hierarchical reinforcement learning model transform from random wandering to efficient problem-solving on the classic BabyAI task.

We explore:
- The BabyAI unlock-and-open task (navigate to key, pick it up, unlock door)
- Hierarchical Reinforcement Machines (HRM) with planner and doer agents
- Real-time visualization of the learning process
- How thought bubbles reveal what the AI is "thinking"

Try the interactive visualization yourself and watch AI learning happen in real-time.
