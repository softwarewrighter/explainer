Language models forget everything between conversations. You explain your project, share context, build understanding, then the session ends and it all vanishes.

Engram fixes this with persistent memory, inspired by research from DeepSeek.

In this demo, I compare a base SmolLM model (135M parameters) against one fine-tuned with Engram patterns. The results speak for themselves:

- Loop completion: Base model gives verbose explanations. Tuned model completes directly.
- Python main guard: Base model rambles. Tuned model outputs the exact completion.
- HTTP 404 question: Base model writes a paragraph. Tuned model answers "404".

Less compute. Faster responses. Aligned outputs. All from ten seconds of training on pattern examples.

Engram caches past interactions by topic, so relevant context is recalled automatically. Try it on your own projects.
