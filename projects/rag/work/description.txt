RAG Explained: How AI Learns to Look Things Up

What if your AI could access your documents instead of making things up?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solves the hallucination problem by grounding AI in real data. Instead of guessing from training, RAG retrieves relevant documents before answering.

The key insight: Give AI access to your information, and it stops making things up.
