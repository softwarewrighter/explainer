[00:15] Here is Claude Code, an AI coding agent, about to run through a demo guide I created for my favicon generator tool.

[00:25] The tool generates favicon images from text or unicode symbols. Simple enough, right?

[00:35] I asked Claude to execute each demo command, display the results, and document what happens.

[00:45] This is vibe coding. Instead of manually testing, I am letting the AI explore and report back.

[00:55] The demo guide covers text favicons, colors, unicode symbols, rotation, and animated GIFs.

[01:05] Let us see what breaks.

[01:15] First up, Demo 1, basic text favicons. Generate AB, X, and SW as favicon images.

[01:25] The AB favicon works. Two letters rendered on a transparent background.

[01:35] Notice the checkered pattern in the preview. That is ImageMagick showing transparency, not a bug.

[01:45] Next, single letter X as a PNG file.

[01:55] First issue. The command saved as favicon dot ico, but tried to display favicon dot png.

[02:05] The dash dash png flag did not change the default output filename. That is bug number one.

[02:15] The display command fails because the file does not exist at that path.

[02:25] Moving on to unicode symbols. This should show a rocket emoji.

[02:35] And we get our first crash. Thread panicked, no fonts available on system.

[02:45] The tool is looking for an emoji font to render the rocket symbol, but this Linux system does not have one installed.

[02:55] Claude checks for Noto Color Emoji font. Not found.

[03:05] This is not a bug in the code. It is a documentation gap. The README should mention emoji font requirements.

[03:15] For Linux users, you need to install noto fonts emoji package.

[03:25] The AI recognizes this and decides to skip unicode demos for now and continue with text-based features.

[03:35] Smart adaptation. Instead of getting stuck, it moves forward with what works.

[03:45] Let me continue with the text-based demos that do work and show what we can preview.

[03:55] Demo 4, Custom colors. White A on blue background.

[04:05] Using hex color codes like hashtag FFFFFF for white and hashtag 0066CC for blue.

[04:15] That works. Saved as white on blue dot ico.

[04:25] Now let us try red X on black. But wait, the demo guide says dash f red, dash b black.

[04:35] Error, Invalid foreground color red. Named colors are not supported.

[04:45] That is bug number two. The tool only accepts hex codes, not CSS color names.

[04:55] This is actually a reasonable feature to add. Red, black, white, blue are common enough.

[05:05] Claude adapts again. Uses hex codes FF0000 for red and 000000 for black.

[05:15] Now it works. We have a workaround, but we should add named color support.

[05:25] Demo 5, Rotation. Letter R rotated 45 degrees clockwise.

[05:35] The dash r flag works. We can see the R tilted in the preview.

[05:45] Counter-clockwise rotation with dash capital R also works. 90 degrees the other way.

[05:55] Transparent background with the dash capital T flag. That works too.

[06:05] So far, hex colors work, rotation works, transparent flag works.

[06:15] Demo 6, Animated GIFs. Spinning S with 30 degree rotation per frame.

[06:25] The animation generates, but the rotation looks slow. 30 degrees per frame is not very dynamic.

[06:35] That is something to note for the demo guide. Use larger rotation values for smoother animation.

[06:45] Claude summarizes what worked so far. Text favicons, hex colors, rotation, animated GIFs.

[06:55] Skipped demos 2 and 3, the unicode features, because no emoji font is installed.

[07:05] Now here is where it gets interesting. Claude suggests installing the font.

[07:15] Sudo pacman dash S noto fonts emoji. This is an Arch Linux system.

[07:25] The font package downloads and installs. About 10 megabytes.

[07:35] Font cache updates. Now let us re-run the unicode demos.

[07:45] Checking fc-list for emoji fonts. Noto Color Emoji is now available.

[07:55] Demo 2 retry, Unicode symbol by alias. Favicon dash dash unicode rocket.

[08:05] It works! We have a rocket emoji favicon. No more panics.

[08:15] Coffee emoji. Beautiful coffee cup on transparent background.

[08:25] Wrench, star, heart. All the unicode aliases are working now.

[08:35] Demo 3, Unicode by code point. U plus 1F600 is the grinning face emoji.

[08:45] 2764 without the U plus prefix. That is the heart symbol.

[08:55] Code points work just like aliases. Both ways to specify unicode characters.

[09:05] Demo 4 revisited with unicode. Star with transparent background.

[09:15] But the demo guide says dash b transparent. Let us see what happens.

[09:25] Error, Invalid background color transparent. Bug number three.

[09:35] The tool has a dash capital T flag for transparency, but does not accept the word transparent as a color value.

[09:45] Easy fix. Use dash T instead. Fire emoji with transparent background works.

[09:55] Demo 5 with unicode, Rotating wrench. 45 degrees clockwise.

[10:05] Animated gear spinning. Animated star spinning. Both work with unicode symbols.

[10:15] All unicode demos complete. 24 files generated total.

[10:25] Final summary. Unicode aliases rocket, coffee, wrench, star, heart, fire, gear all work.

[10:35] Code points work. Transparent backgrounds work. Rotation and animation work.

[10:45] Five bugs found. Named colors, transparent as color value, PNG filename, animation speed defaults, and wrench symbol rendering as text.

[10:55] Plus one documentation gap, emoji font requirements.
