Vibe Coding: AI Agent Finds Bugs in My Favicon Tool (Part 1: Discovery)

Watch as Claude Code, an AI coding agent, explores my favicon CLI tool and discovers 6 bugs, 2 missing features, and a documentation gap - all in one session.

In this video:
- Claude Code runs a guided demo of the favicon generator
- Named colors like "red" and "transparent" are rejected
- Unicode emoji support crashes the tool
- PNG filename doesn't match what's generated
- Animation speed defaults cause confusion
- Wrench symbol renders as text instead of icon
- Numeric code points fail to render

Part 2 coming tomorrow: Watch the AI fix every bug it found!
