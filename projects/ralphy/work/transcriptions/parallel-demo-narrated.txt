 Tasks are defined in a yaml file with parallel group markers. Group 1 has three independent modules. Group 2 has the integration step that runs after. Rolfi starts in parallel mode with three agents. Each agent gets its own Git branch and work tree, so they can work on different files without conflicts. All three agents work simultaneously. The agent 1 builds the user module, agent 2 builds products, agent 3 builds orders. They finish at different times. When group 1 completes, Rolfi merges all three branches back to main. Then group 2 starts with a single agent to integrate the modules together. The Git history shows the parallel work merging together. confirms all modules integrate correctly. Four tasks completed with parallel execution.
