Can AI read all of War and Peace to find a hidden secret? RLM (Recursive Language Model) makes it possible with targeted recursive queries.

In this demo, we challenge RLM to find the password to Prince Andrei's secret vault hidden somewhere in Tolstoy's 3.2 MB, 65,666-line masterpiece. Way too big for any LLM context window!

RLM completes the task in just 2 iterations using only 3,000 tokens - 100% savings compared to sending the full document.

Key features:
- Search massive documents that exceed LLM context limits
- Works with any local LLM via Ollama
- Minimal token usage through recursive narrowing
- Open source Rust CLI tool
