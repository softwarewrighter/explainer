Find all the cat photos in your library using local machine learning. No cloud APIs, no data leaving your machine.

Cat Finder uses YOLOv8 (nano variant) for fast object detection, ONNX Runtime for cross-platform inference, and a Rust CLI for efficient directory scanning. The included Flask web demo provides a visual interface with real-time detection badges.

On the test set: 7 of 9 cats found with zero false positives.
