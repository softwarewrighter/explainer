This tutorial combines sensors, messaging, and robots. First, watch the training phase. The robot learns to click the random sensor, apply modulo ten, and send the result to a nest via a bird. After training, click the robot to run it. The actions happen instantly, so you will not see them animated. But notice the nest counter increases with each click. The robot is producing random numbers modulo ten and sending them to the nest. At the end, click the magnifier on the nest. This reveals the numbers the robot generated. Each click of the trained robot added one number to the queue.
