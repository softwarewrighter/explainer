This is the copy with wand tutorial. The magic wand is a tool that duplicates any widget it touches. Watch the wand copy the number seven. Now the copy gets dropped onto the original. When two numbers touch, they add together. The result is fourteen. We need to drop fourteen into the answer zone. The green checkmark shows success. Now try the practice problem. Use the wand to make two copies of five. Stack all three fives together to get fifteen. Drop fifteen into the practice answer zone. The wand makes deep copies of any widget including boxes.
