This is the bird and nest messaging tutorial. Birds carry messages to their paired nests. The blue bird is connected to the brown nest. Watch what happens when we drag a number to the bird. The bird picks up the number and flies to its nest. The message appears in the nest with a badge showing one item. Send another number to the bird. The bird carries it to the same nest. Now the nest has two messages queued up. Click the nest to pick up the first message. Messages come out in the order they were sent. This is how different parts of your program can communicate.
