This is the train your first robot tutorial. Robots learn by watching your actions. Click the robot to start training. The robot glows yellow to show it is recording. Now drag the number five into the box. Click the robot again to stop training. The robot learned to move a number into the box. Now click the robot to run it. Watch the robot pick up a number and move it to the box. The robot works on any number, not just five. This is called generalization. Keep clicking the robot to process all the numbers. Each click runs the robot once. Programming by demonstration means showing rather than typing code.
