This slide shows three key concepts. First, the bird tooltip shows delivery status and which nest is paired. Second, nest inspection uses the magnifier to see queued messages. Third, the message queue is first in first out, with the oldest message delivered next. Hover over a bird to see its tooltip. The magnifier inspects widgets. Drop it on a nest to see queued messages. Messages are delivered in order, oldest first. The magnifier can also list robot actions when dropped on a robot.
