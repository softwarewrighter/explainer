In the Show Me demo, click the robot to start training. A yellow glow indicates training mode. While training, move a number into the box. Click the robot again to stop training. Now the robot has learned this action. Click the robot to run it. Each click makes the robot pick up a new number and place it in the box, replacing the previous contents. The robot generalizes from your example to work with any number. The Train Your First Robot tutorial showed programming by demonstration.
