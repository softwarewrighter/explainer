This is the robot with sensors tutorial. Sensors produce changing values. The die sensor gives random numbers. The clock sensor shows the current time. Click the robot to start training. Now click the die to generate a random number. The robot records this action. Click the robot to stop training. The robot learned to get random values from the die. Run the robot to see it in action. Each time it runs, it gets a new random number. The random value goes into the box. Use sensors to make programs that respond to changing data. Combine robots with birds and nests for powerful programs.
