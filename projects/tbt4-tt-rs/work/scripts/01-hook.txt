Toon Talk in Rust is a visual programming environment that runs in your browser. You learn by doing, not by typing code. Three levels introduce the concepts. Level one covers basics like numbers and boxes. Level two adds messaging with birds and nests. Level three brings sensors. The tutorials in level three use robots for programming by demonstration. This is a vibe coded homage to decades old ToonTalk.
