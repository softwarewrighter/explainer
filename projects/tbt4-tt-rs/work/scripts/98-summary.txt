This is still a work in progress. The core features are working, numbers, boxes, scales, messaging, and robots. But there is plenty of room to explore. Text operations, more widget types, and persistence are not yet implemented. Each missing feature is an opportunity for vibe coding. Pick something interesting and add it to the codebase. This is a throwback to the original ToonTalk, reimagined in Rust and Web Assembly.
