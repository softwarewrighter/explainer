ToonTalk in Rust (tt-rs) is a visual programming environment that runs in your browser. Learn by doing, not by typing code. This vibe-coded homage to the original ToonTalk brings programming-by-demonstration to the modern web using Rust and WebAssembly.

In this video, you'll see:
- Three learning levels: basics, messaging, and sensors
- Six interactive tutorials with Show Me demonstrations
- Robots that learn by watching you work

Try it yourself - no install required!
