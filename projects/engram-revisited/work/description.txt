From Emulation to Implementation: A Journey Through Engram Memory

We started by training models to behave like they had memory using LoRA fine-tuning. Then we discovered weagan's Engram implementation - real O(1) hash-based memory in about 300 lines of Python. This video documents what we learned: how to integrate it with HuggingFace models, what tasks it excels at (exact-match lookups), and where it struggles (pattern generalization).

The key insight: Engram is a specialized tool, not a general enhancement. Hash-based memory works for consistent recall, not contextual reasoning.

== Key Findings ==

- LoRA emulation improved accuracy 63% (8.6% → 14%)
- Real Engram achieves 100% accuracy on synthetic long-term recall
- Acronym expansion: 75% with Engram vs 12% baseline (+63%)
- Element names: 67% with Engram vs 0% baseline (+67%)
- Capitals: 0% with Engram vs 22% baseline (regression - base model already knew)
- Random synthetic mappings: 0% for both (no semantic signal)
