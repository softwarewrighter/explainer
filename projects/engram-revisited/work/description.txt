From behavioral emulation to real implementation: what we learned building O(1) hash-based memory for language models.

We started by fine-tuning a small model to act like it had memory. LoRA adapters improved accuracy 63%, but the architecture never changed. Then we discovered weagan's Engram repo—real hash-based memory in about 300 lines of Python.

This video documents the journey: porting EnhancedEngramModule to HuggingFace, discovering what works (exact-match lookups, terminology, entity facts) and what doesn't (pattern completion, creative tasks).

Key insight: Engram is a specialized tool for recall, not reasoning.
